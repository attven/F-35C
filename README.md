# Generic, multirole Discord bot

F-35C is designed for you to easily self-host, and use as a template for your own Discord bot project. The codebase is written to be straightforward, clear, and self-explaining,
accompanied by usage of cogs - which makes adding, updating and removing extensions easier and achievable with no downtime.

To get started, simply click **Use this template**, and select either **Open in Codespace** or **[Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=F-35C&template_owner=attventures)**.
